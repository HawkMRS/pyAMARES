Additional Note on MPFIR Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MPFIR function within pyAMARES is inspired by MPFIR function in the Matlab software `SPID <https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sistawww/biomed/etumour/SPID/ManualSPID.pdf>`_, which at the time of this implementation had no clear licensing information available. 
It is important to note that ``pyAMARES.libs.MPFIR`` is an independent implementation developed in Python and does not contain any original SPID code.

This function is included in pyAMARES under the same BSD 3-Clause License, and no claim is made on the original SPID software or its intellectual property. 
Users are advised to ensure their use of the MPFIR function complies with legal and regulatory requirements.
